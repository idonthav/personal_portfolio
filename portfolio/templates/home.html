        <strong><p>Hi! {{ name }}</p></strong> 
        <p>Here is what I think of making a career change and starting a coding career. <br><br>
        For me, the coolest part of coding is, that I can definitely created an visible work than my previous jobs.
        It is not only because coding is a future-proof and lucrative profession, but also it is inclusive to anyone 
        whoever you are and what class you come from. My previous experience has nothing to do with coding. 
        I get ready to start from completely scratch. There were moments of collapse when I was not able to debug
        my code. <br> While, eventually good result comes with persistance and hard-working. In many other industries, 
        performance is hardly quantified and subjective. <br> 'In the realm of the scientific, it became "findable" by anyone'.
